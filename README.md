####A native Mac app for Apple's [infamous](http://fixradarorgtfo.com) [bug reporter](http://bugreport.apple.com/).

Mac and iOS developers need a nice way to submit, update and check on their reported bugs. The web interface is an inelegant solution with many problems. Unfortunately, it's currently the only way of reporting bugs. 

The app I am building essentially recreates the steps one would normally take on bugreport.apple.com and simplifying it in a Mac app. It's a bit of a hack, but it's currently the only way of doing this. There are numerous benefits of having a native Mac app as opposed to using the web interface.

* Receive background updates
* Read report details while offline
* Avoid annoying timeouts

Features in development:

* Add multiple attachments at once
* Add screenshots straight from Photo Stream
* Edit screenshots and video in-app

I believe that more people will be willing to report bugs using this app than they were when they previously had to use Apple's web interface.
